# Fur DB
FurDB is a Relational Database Management System that allows you to allot the size of the value in bits, significantly reducing the space occupied by the data.

You can add [FurDB](https://github.com/furdb/furdb) as a dependency in a Rust project, or you can use its Actix-powered [REST API implementation](https://github.com/furdb/furdb-server) for any Rust or non-Rust project. A [dictionary demo](https://github.com/furdb/fur-dictionary) can be found here.
